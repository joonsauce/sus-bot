# Release Notes
## v1.1.0
- Updated color for help function
- Added error message for help function if user tried to get help for a command that doesn't exist
- Commented out logger because it isn't as useful as initially intended
- Fixed susimg command breaking due to use of deprecated discord.py commands
- More fixes are coming soon - they will be committed to the v2 branch since I want to keep main to be something that is guaranteed to work
- Will be creating project timeline soon - fix for most things should be complete by June 2023, but no promises

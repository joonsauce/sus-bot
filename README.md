# About the Project
A discord bot with influence from the popular indie video game Among Us, with features 
that combines some qualities of other bots.
# Usage
At the moment, the bot is configured to be customized per server; some commands need to be 
hardwired in by the person who wants to use them.

There are a plenty of commands to choose from. The prefix is `s!`
### Command Types
- susrate {user}
  - This command rates a chosen member of the server based on how sus they are. The value is static and does not change.
- susout {user}
  - This command targets a user of doing something sus. The username of the sender still needs fix, a fix will be available soon.
- ari {arg}
  - Two subcommands: `random` or `{number}`
  - The command either plays a random song by Ariana Grande from a chosen playlist, or chosen by a member of the serer.
  - A music bot must be added to the server to be used, but a feature to play music directly from this bot will be coming soon.
  - The bot sends a command to another bot so that the music bot can play the song.

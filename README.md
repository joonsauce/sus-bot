## Check README of the main branch for more information about this template

## List of improvements
- Code restructuring - there's a lot of messy code everywhere and they need to be fixed
  - A lot of the comments are useless and need to be removed
  - Some of the logic is in reverse order and doesn't work sometimes
  - Makes everything a lot easier to read and easier to find issues
- Efficiency update
  - Move as much code as possible into simple conditionals
    - If simple conditionals get too long, create new function - this is mostly for readbility
  - Remove unnecessary stuff
    - There's still a lot of redundancies
  - Move files into appropriate locations
  - Update API calls
    - I have no idea what I was thinking when I originally made these - there's a lot of improvements and will be implemented for v2
- Bug fixes - a lot of things deprecated and causes issues
  - Reddit API doesn't seem to work anymore
- New features - this is a secret, you'll know when time comes :)
- There still are more that I can't think of at the moment, which means this doc will be updated frequently
